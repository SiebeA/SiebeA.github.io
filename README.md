This website includes:

-  my current learning projects:
    - Learning Greek
    - Web dev: HTML, JS, cls (together: Greek_project(GP))
- My current/tentative beliefs/conclusions



## TO-DO GP

- [ ] Provide a random order of the letters of the alphabet that the user needs to complete INSTEAD of a random letter each time.
- [ ] Provide the correct answer when the user has a typo (i.e., the user is close)
- [ ] Add an option for the user to draw a symbol that resembles a letter in a square-space
- [ ] Provide both uppercase and lowercase answers in the answer feedback (e.g., "Incorrect. The correct answer is Νι / νι")
- [ ] Add an option where the user can press a button to pronounce a Greek word, then a Greek ASR model returns the word it inferred from the voice input
- [ ] Add a sound file for each letter to provide audio feedback for correct answers
- [ ] Source the Greek letters from a text file instead of defining it in the script
- [ ] Add a timer to the alphabet practice to track the user's speed and progress.
- [ ] Use an interactive way of pulling up the text instead of footnotes
