    - Learning Greek
    - Web dev: HTML, JS, cls (together: Greek_project(GP))
- My currenlty uphold beliefs/conclusions up for [attack]



## TO-DO GP

- [ ] .
- [ ] Show both letter words, and an examplary word in full caps and normal DONE: now restyle it a bit such that only the letters are in large font
- [ ] Pronounce ie play an audio of the letter when the user submits
- [ ] iota, ιώτα|γιτα seems to have multiple forms; perhaps allow for an OR in the quiz
- [ ] Add an option for the user to draw a symbol that resembles a letter in a square-space
- [ ] Add an option where the user can press a button to pronounce a Greek word, then a Greek ASR model returns the word it inferred from the voice input
- [ ] Add a sound file for each letter to provide audio feedback for correct answers
- [ ] Use an interactive way of pulling up the text instead of footnotes
- [ ] VISUAl-FEAT: show the user where on the keyboard is the Greek letter.
- [ ] Add a timer to the alphabet practice to track the user's speed and progress.
