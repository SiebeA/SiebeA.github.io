		<h1>Beta: 2023, September version</h1>
		<h2>The Greek alphabet is different from either Germanic (English, Germian, etc) or latin languages (Spanish, French) This is often a hurdle for language learners.</h2>
		<h4>This website, therefore, is aimed at teaching you to interpet and use the Greek aphabet in the shortest amount of time possible (less than 5 attention-hours ideally spread out over a couple of days)</h4>
		<h5>The resources on this website are exactly configured for the purpose of getting from 0 to A1 level; and it is my assertion that no other website serves that particular purpose as effective and efficient; as it was exactly developed for that purpose in exact conjunction with my personal practical requirement of learning the Greek language.</h5>

		<h3 style="color: red;">NOTE: Install Greek language keyboard on your PC; for Windows: "Time & Language > Add Language" (also, checkmark the TTS capacity for the proper nouns page)</h3>

		<h3>The links are ordered; the completion of the former facilitates the next. </h3>
